# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Venn

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that lets you coordinate meetup times using information from your google calendar, weather forecast, and other preferences.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our project primarily attempts to create a more user-friendly way to coordinate meetups between groups of people. Simply by logging into the site, users will have the option to import their google calendar, so that the website can automatically determine times that are free for everyone. The host will be able to specify a meeting length, and users will see the times that work best for everyone highlighted and will have the option to add time and weather preferences. Users will have the option to toggle the calendar to display weather and temperature information and will also be able to import other calendar files. Once a date and time are set, users will be able to confirm or deny the time, and once confirmed, the event will be automatically added to everyone’s google calendar.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TFs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will at least have implemented a feature using the Google Calendar API to sync email’s data to our database and have created a user interface that displays the ideal times for users to meet in an easy-to-read format.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The website would incorporate weather forecasts using an API and allow users to specify ideal weather/temperature and time preferences.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The website would be aesthetic and have a user-friendly user interface, as well as maybe incorporating algorithms in order to highlight the most preferable times. Once set, the events would also be automatically added to everyone’s google calendar.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We first need to research how to implement a Google Calendar API, how to store/retrieve calendar files, and how our website should look. We’ll need to acquire the necessary skills to work with API’s primarily, along with being comfortable manipulating/adding/retrieving data from the database type we choose to implement. Our collaboration strategy is to all work on the same basic tasks (API, calendar files) together before each branching out to implement more specific, feature-oriented tasks.
